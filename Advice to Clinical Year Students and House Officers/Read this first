This is a talk i gave to some students on the ward while they were preparing for their final year exams.
        The talk is in two parts - we had to break for a few minutes to attend to an emergency, then we came back to continue.
        Kindly pardon me for the background noise (as expected, the ward was busy).
        [This talk was given in the year 2014 by Dr Hamza Bawumia].
