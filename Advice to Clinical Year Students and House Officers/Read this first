This is a talk i gave to some students on the ward while they were preparing for their final year exams.
        The talk is in two parts - we had to break for a few minutes to attend to an emergency, then we came back to continue.
        Kindly pardon me for the background noise (as expected, the ward was busy).
        [This talk was given in the year 2014 by Dr Hamza Bawumia].


There is a picture included in this folder. The picure shows the list points from which a gave this talk.
You are advised to have a look at the listed points before you listen to the audios. 
This will help you to have a better understanding of this whole talk/advice.

Also, it is best to listen with your earphones since my voice is a little low. 
Thank you.
